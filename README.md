WaveSim3
========

**WaveSim3** is a 2D Wave Simulator accelerated by OpenCL, which uses SFML for GUI. It reaches over 60 FPS at 1600 * 800 grid size (also the rendering resolution) on my AMD laptop, taking up only 50% of the GPU.

This is my first project with OpenCL. In the future, I will try to boost it more.
